# Deep Learning for Experimental Psychologists and Cognitive Neuroscientists

This [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) covers several deep-learning topics building slowly 
from basic concepts to more  advanced usages. The materials in this book initiated originally from 
the teaching syllabus for the  deep learning course taught at [Brain and Behaviour 
Master programme](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/mbb?set_language=de) 
taught at [Justus-Liebig University of Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/jlyou/en/index.html). 
While some examples are tailored for *Experimental Psychologists* and *Cognitive Neuroscientists*, 
the content should be useful to anyone interested in deep learning.
