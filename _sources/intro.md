# Welcome

This Jupyter Book covers several deep-learning topics building slowly from basic concepts to more 
advanced usages. The materials in this book initiated originally from the teaching syllabus for the 
deep learning course taught at [Brain and Behaviour Master programme](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/mbb?set_language=de) 
taught at [Justus-Liebig University of Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/jlyou/en/index.html). 
While some examples are tailored for *Experimental Psychologists* and *Cognitive Neuroscientists*, 
the content should be useful to anyone interested in deep learning.
