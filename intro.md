# Welcome

Welcome to this Jupyter Book on deep learning, designed for students from all around the 
world. The content covers a broad spectrum of deep learning topics, starting from foundational 
principles and gradually advancing to more complex applications. Originally developed for the deep 
learning course in the [Brain and Behaviour Master's programme](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/mbb?set_language=de)
at [Justus-Liebig University of Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/jlyou/en/index.html), 
this material is not only tailored for Experimental Psychologists* and *Cognitive 
Neuroscientists* but is also suitable for anyone interested in deep learning. Whether you are new to 
the field or looking to deepen your understanding, this book offers valuable insights and practical 
examples to enhance your learning experience.

```{admonition} Play with notebooks!
The best way to master the material is through hands-on practice! Each Jupyter Notebook can be 
executed directly in Google Colab by clicking the <i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> icon 
at the top of the notebook. You can also access all materials in our 
[GitHub repository <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/DeepLearning-JupyterBook/deeplearning-jupyterbook.github.io), 
which you can clone to run locally on your own computer.
```

```{admonition} Please give feedback!
:class: tip
If you come across any issues, bugs, typos, or anything else, please let us know! You can report 
them through the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> [issue tracker](https://github.com/DeepLearning-JupyterBook/deeplearning-jupyterbook.github.io/issues) 
or simply click the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> icon at the top of any page and select 
“open issue”. We also welcome requests for new materials, and if you’d like to contribute,

## External materials

Below is a list of materials that can complement the course content.

### Python tutorials

While the tutorials explain Python codes in great detail, familiarity with Python is required to 
follow the course. Useful materials for inexperienced Python programmers:
1. [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
2. [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
3. [Python Numpy Tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

### Recommended resources
There are several online resources covering deep-learning theoretical and practical aspects:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
2. [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html)
3. [UvA Deep Learning Tutorials](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
