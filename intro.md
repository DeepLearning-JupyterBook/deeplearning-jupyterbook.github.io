# Welcome

This Jupyter Book covers several deep-learning topics building slowly from basic concepts to more 
advanced usages. The materials in this book initiated originally from the teaching syllabus for the 
deep learning course taught at [Brain and Behaviour Master programme](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/studium/studienangebot/master/mbb?set_language=de) 
taught at [Justus-Liebig University of Giessen](https://www.uni-giessen.de/jlyou/en/index.html). 
While some examples are tailored for *Experimental Psychologists* and *Cognitive Neuroscientists*, 
the content should be useful to anyone interested in deep learning.

```{admonition} Play with notebooks!
The best way to learn the presented materials is by getting your hands dirty! All Jupyter Notebooks 
can be executed on Google Colab by directly clicking on the <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-rocket"></i> icon on 
top of each notebook. All materials are also available in our
[GitHub repository <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/DeepLearning-JupyterBook/deeplearning-jupyterbook.github.io), 
clone it to run it locally on your computer.


```

```{admonition} Please give feedback!
:class: tip
Please report any issues/bugs/typos/etc. you notice. Either go the
<i class="fab fa-github"></i> [issue tracker](https://github.com/DeepLearning-JupyterBook/deeplearning-jupyterbook.github.io/issues) 
or directly click on the  <i class="fab fa-github"></i> icon on top of each page and then 
'open issue`. We also accept requests for new materials, and of course, we highly appreciate it if you
decide to contribute by pull requests <i class="fa-regular fa-face-smile"></i>.

## Background materials

### Python tutorials

While the tutorials explain Python codes in great detail, familiarity with Python is required to 
follow the course. Useful materials for inexperienced Python programmers:
1. [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
2. [W3Schools Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
3. [Python Numpy Tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)

### Recommended resources
There are several online resources covering deep-learning theoretical and practical aspects:
1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
2. [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html)
3. [UvA Deep Learning Tutorials](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
